\title{PCS for One-Stage Test (Failure Event)}
\usage{
one_stage_test_pcs0(n, e, s, p, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer. Sample size per treatment arm.}

\item{e}{Numeric/integer. Efficacy threshold.}

\item{s}{Numeric/integer. Safety threshold.}

\item{p}{Numeric matrix with 2 rows. Each row gives joint endpoint
probabilities for one treatment arm.}

\item{k}{Integer. (Currently unused.) Included for interface compatibility.}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar giving the probability of incorrect selection.
}
\description{
Compute the probability of accept the null hypothesis (PCS0) for a one-stage test
under joint binary endpoints.
}
\examples{
# Requires joint_prob() to be available
# p <- rbind(c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4),
#            c(0.1, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5))
# one_stage_test_pcs0(n = 10, e = 1, s = 1, p = p, k = 0)
