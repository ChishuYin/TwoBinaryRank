\title{PCS0 for Subset Selection}
\usage{
subset_pcs0(c1, c2, n, p, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{c1}{Integer. Efficacy cutoff used in the subset rule.}

\item{c2}{Integer. Safety cutoff used in the subset rule.}

\item{n}{Integer. Sample size per treatment arm.}

\item{p}{Numeric matrix with at least 2 rows. Row 1 contains joint endpoint
probabilities for the control arm; row 2 contains joint endpoint
probabilities for the experimental arm. The ordering must match \code{joint_prob()}.}

\item{k}{Integer. Number of experimental treatments (used as an exponent in the PCS0 formula).}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar giving PCS0.
}
\description{
Compute PCS0 (probability of select the control treatment) for the
subset selection procedure based on two binary endpoints.
}
\examples{
# Requires joint_prob() to be available
# p <- rbind(c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4),
#            c(0.1, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5))
# subset_pcs0(c1 = 3, c2 = 3, n = 10, p = p, k = 2)
