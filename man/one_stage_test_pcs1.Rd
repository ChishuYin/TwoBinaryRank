\title{Power for One Stage Test}
\usage{
one_stage_test_pcs1(n, e, s, p, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer. Sample size per treatment arm.}

\item{e}{Numeric/integer. Efficacy margin/threshold; treatment 2 is considered better on efficacy if (c - a) >= e.}

\item{s}{Numeric/integer. Safety margin/threshold; treatment 2 is considered better on safety if (d - b) >= s.}

\item{p}{Numeric matrix with 2 rows. Row 1 contains joint endpoint probabilities for treatment 1;
row 2 contains joint endpoint probabilities for treatment 2. Each row should be a length-4 vector
giving probabilities for the four joint outcomes (ordering consistent with \code{joint_prob()}).}

\item{k}{Integer. (Currently unused.) Reserved for compatibility with other procedures.}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar giving the PCS.
}
\description{
Compute the probability of reject the null hypothesis for a one-stage test
comparing two treatments under joint binary endpoints.
}
\examples{
# Example (requires `joint_prob()` to be defined in the package):
# p <- rbind(c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4),
#            c(0.1, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5))
# one_stage_test_pcs(n = 10, e = 1, s = 1, p = p, k = 0)
